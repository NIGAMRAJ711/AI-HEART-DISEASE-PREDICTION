This repository contains the source code for Heartscope AI, a health-tech project designed to predict the risk of heart disease using machine learning (logistic regression). It features:

Preprocessing on the Framingham Heart Study dataset (missing value imputation, normalization)

Training and evaluation of a logistic regression model (Accuracy ≈ 85%, ROC-AUC ≈ 0.71)

User-friendly console interface for real-time health risk input

Integration of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for feature importance

PDF report generation with prediction results, health scoring, lifestyle recommendations, and embedded visuals
